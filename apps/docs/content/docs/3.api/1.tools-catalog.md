## Identify write operations

All tools marked **Write** can be gated with [`requireApproval`](/guide/approval-control). In production, always pair them with:

- a scoped [preset](/guide/presets) to limit which writes are available
- a fine-grained [token](/guide/token-permissions) to limit what the token can do
- an explicit approval policy to intercept mutations before execution
