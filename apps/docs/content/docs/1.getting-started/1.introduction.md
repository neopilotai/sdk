`@repolens-ai/sdk` wraps the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) into AI-callable tool definitions that plug directly into the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs).

Pass them to `generateText`, `streamText`, or any agent loop — the model decides which GitHub operations to call.

## Explore the tools

The SDK ships **18 tools** covering repositories, pull requests, issues, commits, and code search. Each tool maps to a single GitHub REST endpoint and is fully typed with [Zod](https://zod.dev) schemas.

Browse the full list in the [Tools Catalog](/api/tools-catalog).

## Compose tools with presets

Instead of wiring tools individually, use a **preset** to get a curated subset for a specific workflow:

| Preset | Tools included | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `repo-explorer` | repository metadata, branches, file content, code search | knowledge retrieval, repo Q&A |
| `code-review` | pull requests, commits, file diffs, review comments | PR copilots, change summaries |
| `issue-triage` | issues, labels, comments, close/create | support triage, backlog bots |
| `maintainer` | all tool families | full operator workflows |

Learn more in [Scope with Presets](/guide/presets).

## Use pre-built agents

For the highest level of abstraction, `createGithubAgent` returns a ready-to-use agent with tools, presets, and system instructions wired together:

```ts [review-agent.ts]
import { createGithubAgent } from '@repolens-ai/sdk'

const reviewer = createGithubAgent({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6',
  preset: 'code-review',
  system: 'You review PRs for security issues. Cite file paths and line numbers.',
})
```

See [Examples](/guide/examples) for more agent patterns.
