Presets limit the tools your agent can access to a specific workflow. This reduces the attack surface and keeps prompts focused.

## Apply a single preset

Use a preset to restrict the tools to a specific capability domain. For example, a code review bot only needs pull request and commit tools:

```ts [review-bot.ts]
import { createRepoLens } from '@repolens-ai/sdk'

const tools = createRepoLens({
  preset: 'code-review',
})
```

## Combine multiple presets

When a workflow spans multiple domains, pass an array. This agent can both review PRs and manage issues:

```ts [triage-and-review.ts]
import { createRepoLens } from '@repolens-ai/sdk'

const tools = createRepoLens({
  preset: ['code-review', 'issue-triage'],
})
```

## Pick the right preset

| Preset | Tools included | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `repo-explorer` | repository metadata, branches, file content, code search | knowledge retrieval, repo Q&A |
| `code-review` | pull requests, commits, file diffs, review comments | PR copilots, change summaries |
| `issue-triage` | issues, labels, comments, close/create | support triage, backlog bots |
| `maintainer` | all tool families | operator workflows with strict approvals |

## Pair presets with token scopes

Each preset maps to specific [GitHub token permissions](/guide/token-permissions):

- `repo-explorer` — read-only token, no write permissions needed
- `code-review` — add `pull_requests: write` only if comments are needed
- `issue-triage` — add `issues: write`
- `maintainer` — all write scopes, always paired with [approval control](/guide/approval-control)

::tip
Default to the smallest preset that can complete the task. Add more capabilities only after your prompt and approval policy are stable.
